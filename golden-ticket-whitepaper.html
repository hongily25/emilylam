          <p>Starting in 2014, new types of attacks began appear that target Kerberos, the default authentication protocol in Windows 2000 and later domains. Publicly available toolkits including Mimikatz and WCE provide the means to develop Pass-the-Ticket attacks that allow hackers to breach networks by copying tickets from a compromised end-user machine, or from a delegated authorization server.

          </p>
          <p>These attacks typically begin in one of two ways<sup><a href="http://www.aorato.com" data-toggle="tooltip" target="_blank" title="“Pass-the-Ticket,” http://www.aorato.com, accessed 4/6/2015.
">1</a></sup>:
            <ul>
              <li>The attacker steals a <strong>Ticket Granting Ticket</strong> or <strong>Service Ticket</strong> from an individual Windows machine, and then uses the stolen ticket to impersonate a user or process to gain lateral movement within the network and compromise more machines,
              </li>
              <li>The attacker steals <strong>Ticket Granting Tickets</strong> or <strong>Service Tickets</strong> by compromising a server that is delegated to perform authorization on the users' behalf,
              </li>
            </ul>

          </p>
          <p>Once an attacker steals one of these so-called Silver Tickets<a href="http://blog.varonis.com/microsoft-fixes-kerberos-silver-ticket-vulnerability/" data-toggle="tooltip" target="_blank" title="“Microsoft Fixes a Silver Ticket Kerberos Vulnerability,” http://blog.varonis.com/microsoft-fixes-kerberos-silver-ticket-vulnerability, accessed 4/15/2015"><sup>2</sup></a>, he can use it to gain lateral movement within the network, seek out additional permissions, and extract or modify private data. An eventual goal could be to steal the password hash of the krbtgt account on a domain controller, used by Kerberos to encrypt Ticket Granting Tickets.
          </p>
          <p>Once he possesses this password hash, an attacker could create unlimited tickets, granting any level of access, with virtually unlimited lifetimes; this is the so-called Golden Ticket. It’s important to note that prevailing security countermeasures are ineffective in curtailing this type of attack. And, the assault can be initiated from any computer, whether or not that machine is part of the targeted domain.
          </p>
          <h2 id="FewAvailableCountermeasures">Few Available Countermeasures
</h2>
          <p>In general, Golden Ticket exploits can't be blocked by prevailing security countermeasures:
          </p>

          <div class="well">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Golden Ticket attacks exploit the default authentication in Windows domains, allowing attackers to impersonate users and processes to gain lateral movement throughout a network. Common counter-measures don't work. Here’s why:
              <ul>
                <li>Changing passwords of impersonated users and processes won’t invalidate stolen tickets or block their use.
                </li>
                <li>Multi-Factor Authentication is bypassed by Pass-the-Ticket attacks, and cannot block this exploit.
                </li>
                <li>System logs won't necessarily reveal any unusual activity resulting from the use of stolen Kerberos tickets.
                </li>
              </ul><strong>Solution:
</strong> Lieberman Software provides the tools needed to stabilize your environment and reduce your network attack surface — enforcing frequent password changes and secure escalation to block attackers’ lateral movements. Take advantage of our proven technology to reliably secure your infrastructure in real-time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Compromised tickets are not invalidated by ad-hoc changes of local or domain passwords.</li>
              <li>Pass-the-Ticket exploits bypass Multi-factor Authentication altogether.
              </li>
              <li>Results from exploited tickets are not found by scanning system logs, since the activity oftentimes appears normal.
              </li>
              <li>Shortening ticket lifetimes enough to mitigate the threat would interfere with applications and business processes that rely on this form of authentication.
              </li>
            </ul>Fortunately there are steps you can take to mitigate the threat.

          </p>
          <h3 id="StabilizeYourEnvironment">1. Stabilize Your Environment</h3>
          <p>The first step to mitigate Pass-the-Ticket exploits is to reduce the attack surface of your environment so that individuals and processes that could possess exploited tickets get only limited lateral movement inside the network. Start by removing weak and potentially shared individual local administrator logins on computers and other devices, replacing these with cryptographically complex and sufficiently unique passwords that are frequently changed, and whose disclosure and use is audited and reported.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>User Manager Pro Suite (UMPS)</strong> from Lieberman Software makes it easy to find, report, and change unsecured local user accounts — whether on dozens or tens of thousands of systems at a time. A user without membership in the local Administrators group — something UMPS can remove — cannot easily perform password, hash and ticket credential exfiltration. Another well-known vulnerability or additional zero-day exploit for escalation is normally required when local administrator rights are removed from users. By requiring two or more attack technologies, the probability of a successful attack is diminished significantly.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Enterprise Random Password Manager (ERPM™)</strong> automates the discovery and frequent rotation of privileged accounts, replacing reused and easily compromised credentials with cryptographically complex, frequently changed, unique passwords that help to limit the ability of hackers to exploit new credentials and gain lateral movement inside the network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3 id="EnforceSecureEscalation">2. Enforce Secure Escalation
</h3>
          <p>You can minimize the presence of credentials that attackers can use to gain control of your network.
            <ul>
              <li>ERPM gives authorized users delegated privileged access to applications that can be remotely launched on a secure bastion server, with a single click. This allows untrusted clients on untrusted networks (and potentially compromised systems) the ability to run applications in a tamper-free mode, with strong authentication that includes multi-factor authentication and approval workflows.
              </li>
              <li>ERPM also provides secure escalation workflows to give authorized administrators temporary membership in pre-defined groups with elevated privileges — only for authorized systems — and then automatically removes that access after each documented task is completed. This helps to further reduce the attack surface of your network by minimizing the presence of highly privileged logins.
              </li>
            </ul>Each of these measures can help limit the ability of attackers to access additional network resources after they have exploited a computer or impersonated a user using a Pass-the-Ticket attack.

          </p>
          <h3 id="EstablishAProcessForRapidRemediation">3. Establish a Process for Rapid Remediation
</h3>
          <p>ERPM gives you automated tools to remove Pass-the-Ticket access from compromised machines.
            <ul>
              <li>An exclusive <strong>Security Double-Tap™</strong> feature changes passwords twice on potentially compromised machines – on a schedule or on-demand. This forces rapid replication of the changed credentials throughout the domain to block the use of compromised accounts.
              </li>
              <li>In conjunction with this process, you can optionally configure an automatic chained reboot of target systems to clear memory of hashes and passwords after a user escalation period is completed, and after changes to systems have been made using escalated credentials.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>These features can be used to quickly remediate a wide range of Windows systems — including end-user machines, delegated ticket servers, and Key Domain Controllers (KDCs) should it be necessary.
