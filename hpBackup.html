  <div><i>When I was 13,</i> I was a graphic designer on <a href="the-dark-arts.net" target="_blank">The Dark Arts</a> - a Harry Potter design community. I created banners for writers on <a href="harrypotterfanfiction.com" target="_blank">Harry Potter Fan Fiction.</a><br><br>

  <div><i>When I was 18,</i> I became the graphic design head and editor-in-chief of my school’s yearbook. There were tons of long nights and deadlines, but somehow I made it through and went to UCLA. I saw my first live quidditch match. We beat USC! (Our nemesis)

  <div><i>When I was 21,</i> I flew to Boston to do an internship as a technical writer. I think it was my graphic design skills that got me hired. That was the year I was sorted by Pottermore and joined the Slytherin house on Reddit.

  <div><i>And now I'm 22.</i> I work as a Marketing intern in Beverly Hills and I’m going to graduate in June. My favorite part of the job is creating new content and just being creative. Who would have thought it would pay off?

  <div><i>I had no idea</i> that the graphic design stuff I was doing when I was 13 would impact my life so much or that I would still be active in the Harry Potter community. I can’t think of anything else that has had such a permanent trace on my life. I outgrew my childhood boy bands and Saturday morning TV shows, yet Harry Potter remained.<br><br>If I could speak to my 13-year-old self and she asked me, “Do you still make graphics? Are you still into the Harry Potter series? Even after all this time?” I would say to her, <b>"Always."</b>
