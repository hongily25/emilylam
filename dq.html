     <div id="3dq1" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">Broca's aphasia is a type of speech impairment located in the left frontal lobe. It sounds like broken speech. People with Broca's aphasia have difficulty with syntax. They speak slowly and have lots of pauses.<br></div>

     <div id="3dq2" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">Wernicke's aphasia is a type of speech impairment located in the posterior temporal gyrus. The speech of a Wernicke's aphasic does not make semantic sense but the syntax is OK. There is some phonological impairment.<br></div>

     <div id="3dq3" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">A split brain patient has their corpus callosum severed so their right hemisphere cannot communicate with their left hemisphere. It tells us that the left side of the brain is responsive for speech. The right side may not be able to speak but it can still draw shapes. It tells us that the brain has independent functions.<br></div>

    <h3 class="panel-title">1. What is fast mapping? How do we know whether it is unique to human language? <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq1');"><div class="pull-right"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span></div></a></h3></div>
  
     <div id="2dq1" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">Fast mapping is associating the meaning of a word with its referent in a single exposure. It is single trial learning. It is not unique to human language. Animals like dogs have mechanism for intelligence that we also share. A border collie can recognize new stuffed animals by name through the process of elimination.<br></div>

     <div id="2dq2" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">Children learn without explicit instruction while dogs require extensive training. Dogs also don't have vocal chords. For chimps, they created few spontaneous signs. The word order was idosyncratic.<br></div>

How does it support the idea <br>that language is a biological system? <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq3');"><div class="pull-right"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span></div></a></h3></div>
     <div id="2dq3" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">A critical period is the developmental time period in which language is learned. It is also a period of neural plasticity. The evidence for it is that babies who speak another language before puberty can become bilingual. A girl named Genie was abused and didn't learn language during the critical period. As a result, she never was able to speak properly. She couldn't use auxiliaries for example. This supports the idea that language is a biological system because Genie could not be trained to speak English properly. It shows that language must be learned during the critical period or else it is lost forever.<br></div>

     <div id="2dq4" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">A homesign system is a set of gestural signs spontaneously developed by deaf individuals to communicate when sign language is unknown. Nicaraguan Sign Language was developed by deaf children with considerable complexity. Younger students were able to adopt and learn twice as fast.<br></div>

How is it used in language research to support<br>the idea that language is domain specific? <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq5');"><div class="pull-right"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span></div></a></h3></div>
     <div id="2dq5" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">Double association is the showing independence by finding distinct situations in which there's cognitive but not language impairment and language but not cognitive impairment. It supports the idea that language is domain specific, meaning some linguistic functions develop as modules.<br></div>

    <h3 class="panel-title">1. Describe in your own words, what a model is. Give an example. <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('1dq1');"><div class="pull-right"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span></div></a></h3></div>
  
     <div id="1dq1" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">A model is a representation of reality. It should be guided by a research question and explain a desired phenomena. For example, given an image of a cat, a model can be a perfect fit, a good fit, or a poor fit. A perfect fit is an exact image of the cat. It is not simple nor generalizable. A good fit is a drawing of a cat. It is not the same as the image, but the drawing captures the qualities of the cat well. A poor fit is a cat stick figure. It is too simple and does not capture the likeless of the cat well.<br></div>

     <div id="1dq2" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">Model building should be predictive and falsifiable. It should also be simple but still capture the data accurately.<br></div>

     <div id="1dq3" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">A population is the group one's study is about. A sample is the group that one's study actually tested. We usually test a sample because a population is too large.<br></div>

    <h3 class="panel-title">4. What is meant by a module? Give one property and explain its relation to illusions. <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('1dq4');"><div class="pull-right"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span></div></a></h3></div>
     <div id="1dq4" style="display:none;"><div class="panel-body">A module is a discrete processing unit that is organized by component parts. It is fast, automatic, mandatory, and isolated from other modules. The two pictures of Maragaret Thatcher is an optical illusion. We look for eyes and mouths to be oriented a certain way. When a face is upside but the eyes and mouths remain in their original positions, the image looks acceptable. But when we turn the image right-side up, the image looks completely distorted. <br></div>
