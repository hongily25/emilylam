						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('12dq1');"> 1. Explain the phonological loop and how the word length effect indicates its limited capacity. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>

					<div id="12dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The phonological loop is the process of rehearsal. We store units of memory in working memory and rehearse it. The word length effects says that it is easier to remember shorter words in a list than longer words in a list. This is because it takes longer to rehearse a word that takes longer to say than words that are shorter to say.

					</div>
					<div id="12dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The articulatory suppression effect states that when people engage in a second process that interferes with the phonological loop it is harder to remember words. For example, having participants say "the" while they are trying to remember words makes it difficult for them to recall the words later.

					</div>
					<div id="12dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">We measure reading span by seeing if participants can remember the last word of a sentence in the order that they appear. Participants have a harder time remember object extracted relative clauses because it is more complex than subject extracted relative clauses.

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('11dq1');"> 1. What is the active filler strategy? Illustrate with an example.<div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>

					<div id="11dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The active filler strategy occurs when there is a wh- word that triggers a gap. We try to fill in the gap as soon as possible. For example, in the sentence <i>Who did the boy talk to __?</i> the active filler strategy posits a gap after "to".

					</div>
					<div id="11dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The filled gap effect is the processing penalty that occurs when the active filler model posits a gap that is already filled. For example, in the sentence <i>Who did the boy say the president hated __?</i> the active filler strategy wants to fill the gap as soon as possible after "say" but it is already filled by the president. It is harder to process <i>What did the boy say the president hated?</i> than <i>What did the boy say?</i>. The alternative model does not predict a penalty whereas the active filler strategy does.

					</div>
					<div id="11dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A saccade is ballistic eye movement jumping from one fixation point to another. The perceptual span is 7-8 characters on the right and 3-4 on the left. There was an experiment in which subjects read. The eye tracker tracked where the participants eyes were. The computer XXX'd out words beyond 4 characters to the left and 8 characters to the right and participants didn't notice because it was outside of their perceptual span.

					</div>
					<div id="11dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The word superiority effect is the effect that we can read words as quickly as we can read individual letters. For example, we can recognize that there's a D in READ with the same speed as in D. It shows that we do parallel processing because we don't individually process each letter in a word but rather as units. It supports top-down because we use contextually information and semantic knowledge.

					</div>
					<div id="11dq5" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The dual route model of reading states that we have two routes of reading. We can access the meaning directly from the lexicon or we can engage the auditory route by converting the letters into phones and making phonemes and then acessing the meaning. The auditory route is for less common words. Pure alexia is a condition that supports the independence of the two routes. People who have alexia can recognize individual letters but cannot read words.

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('10dq1');"> 1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a one-stage and a two-stage model? What are examples of each?<div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>

					<div id="10dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A one-stage model is one in which the parser and the processor occur at the same time. In a two-stage model, the parser occurs first and makes a syntactic tree. Then the processor checks for semantic sense. If it is correct, it moves on. If it doesn't, then it makes the parser redo the syntactic structure. The garden path model is an example of the two-stage model. The sentence <i>The horse raced by the barn fell</i> shows that the parser prefers to make raced a main verb. However, the processor realizes that it is wrong so it makes the parser redo the syntactic structure. An example of a one-stage model is the Multiple Constraints model. 
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('10dq2');">2. Name one criticism of the Garden Path Model. Give experimental findings that either support or challenge the criticism.  <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="10dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">One criticism of the Garden Path Model is that sub-categorization of verbs can affect the parser. For example, in the sentence <i>The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable</i> doesn't lead to the garden path effect like <i>The witness examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable.</i> This is because <i>evidence</i> can't be a main verb like <i>witness.</i>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
					


				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('10dq3');"> 3. Briefly explain the basic principles of the Multiple Constraints model. How does it treat garden path sentences?    <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="10dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The Multiple Constraints model is that it choose the best syntactic structure based on a list of criteria. With garden path sentences it makes multiple trees at the same time and chooses the best tree based on the given contraints of the language.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('10dq4');">4. Briefly explain the basic principles of the Good Enough model. What is one piece of evidence in support of it?<div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="10dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The Good Enough model is based on the premise that during speech we don't have enough time to process detailed syntactic trees. So we make shallow trees and adjust on the fly. One piece of evidence in support of it is that when we incorrectly process a sentence we still remember it. For example, in the sentence <i>While the mother bathed the baby played in the crib </i> we recall that the mother bathed the baby when she didn't.

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('9dq1');"> 1. What are the two kinds of structural ambiguity we discussed and what do they reveal about the grammar or language processing? Illustrate with a concrete example. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>

					<div id="9dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The two kinds of structural ambiguity are global and temporary ambiguity. I.e. Global ambiguity is "The man saw the boy with the telescope". The PP "With the telescope" can attach to the boy (the boy is carrying the telescope) or seeing (the man is using the telescope to see the boy, creepy). Temporary ambiguity is swan boat. It can be a boat made out of swans or it can be a boat full of swans or it can be a boat shaped like a swan. 
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('9dq2');"> 2. State the principle of Minimal Attachment. Illustrate how it works with an example.  <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="9dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The Principle of Minimal Attachment is that we should make a tree with the fewest number of nodes when we are processing a language. Basically, keep it simple, stupid. Don't make trees with unnecessary nodes. In the example <i>The boy named</i> will usually be taken as a main verb rather than a reduced relative clause because it is more work. 
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
					


				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('9dq3');">3. State the principle of Late Closure. Illustrate how it works with an example.  <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="9dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The Principle of Late Closure is that we should attach the newest word to the most recent constituent rather than backtracking and attaching it to a higher constituent in the tree. In the example, <i>The man saw the boy with the binoculars</i> we usually attach binoculars to the boy first so that we think the boy is carrying the binoculars rather than the man.

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('9dq4');">4. What is the difference between the parser and the processor on the Garden Path Model? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="9dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The parser builds the syntactic tree. The processor makes sense of the parser using top-down knowledge and checks the semantics. It comes after the parser and tells the parser to redo the sentence if it does not make sense.

					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('8dq1');"> 1. Describe the Hierarchical Network Model. How is it structured? What is the prototypicality effect and why is it problematic for HNM?<div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>

					<div id="8dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The Hierarchial Network Model is that a structure that organizes concepts as nodes in a hiearchial manner. Nodes connect to each other through taxonomic or attrubtive relations. Taxonomic relations can be hyponymy or hypernymy The prototypicality effect is that we are faster to say a word fits into a category when it is a typical example. It is problematic because we are faster to associate a canary with bird than penguin with bird. HNM predicts that we will recognize that a canary is a bird just as quickly as penguin.

					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('8dq2');">2. What are the three stages of the cohort model? What is the recognition point and what stage does it belong to?  <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="8dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">1. Generate initial cohort of lexical items. Activate possible items that match the phoneme. 2. Select a lexical item so that it is unambiguous. 3. Integrate the word with the rest of the sentence. If it doesn't make semantic sense, it will cause a spike in N400. The recognition point is when we select a word and cannot go back. It belongs to the second stage, selection.

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('8dq3');"> 3. What are the major factors that affect word recognition? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>

					</div>
					<div id="8dq4" style="display:none;">

					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('7dq1');"> 1. What is the lexical bias effect? How would Fromkin's serial model explain it? How about Dell's parallel model? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a>
			
			</h3>
					</div>

					<div id="7dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Speech errors result in words that already exist more than non-words. Monitors after it has been said. A parallel model would deal with it in terms of top-down processing. In the serial model you have to add in an editor. You can selectivley target this process.

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('7dq2');"> 2. What is the motor theory of speech? What evidence do we have for and against it?<div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="7dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The motor theory of speech is the theory that we perceive sounds by recognizing the vocal gestures used to make the speech rather than listening to the sound. The McGurk effect is evidence for it because when we see a speaker say [ga] but hear [ba] we think the speaker is saying [da]. It shows that we don't perceive only sound in isolation - we use visual cues such as vocal track gestures to determine speech. The evidence against it is that infants can discriminate the sound and animals are able to discriminate sounds.

					</div>
				</div>
					


				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('7dq3');">3. Describe the basics of categorical perception. What are its two tasks and why are they each necessary? What does it reveal about speech perception?<div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="7dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Categorical perception is when people perceive sound not on a gradient but in categories. For example, [ba] is heard as [b] even though the voice onset time might differ by a little bit. People perceive different VOT as the same category even though the physic acoustics might be different. The two tasks are identify the sound and discriminating the sound from other sounds. It reveals that we perceive speech in categories and don't notice difference once we've placed a sound in its category.

					</div>
					<div id="7dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Phoneme restoration is that we can restore phonemes even if it's interrupted by a cough, white noise, etc. It tells us that we do top-down processing in speech perception because we don't hear individual phones and then put it together. We treat it as a whole so even if a phone is missing we are still able to understand the whole phoneme. I.e. The state senator spoke at the conference. When we remove the [s] from state and replace it with a cough, people still think they heard the [s]. Also, i.e. the news forecast said nothing about rain. People are better able to understand the sentence when there is white noise rather than silence. We think the sentence is continuous if there is white noise even though phones are missing.

					</div>
					<div id="7dq5" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The McGurk effect is when you hear a sound, ie [ba] but see a different sound like [ga], and perceive it as a different sound, ie [da]. It tells us that we process sounds top-down. We pull in visual information and other contexts. Even when we hear perfect sounds, when we see a mismatch it can cause an auditory illusion.

					</div>
					<div id="4dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">There are rarely definitive pauses between words in a speech stream. Children might use top-down, already established information. Children use <b>phonological bootstrapping</b> - statistical regularities to determine likely word boundaries.

					</div>
					<div id="4dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">
							Whole object assumption - word labels refer to whole object. Ex. You hear gavagai and see a rabbit. What does gavagai mean? The whole rabbit, not just the rabbit's ears.
							<br>
							<br> Taxonomic assumption - children choose taxonomic association over thematic association. Ex. If you have an image of a dog. "Find another fep". Children will choose the taxonomic associate. Children will try to find similar things to place in the category.
							<br>
							<br> Mutual exclusivity - children assume that one word cannot refer to two different kinds of things. "Where is the dax"? Children will pick one. One association with one label. Monolingual children think there is only one word for one thing. Bilingual children delay this because they know that horse means horse in English but caballo also means horse but in Spanish.

			</h3>
					</div>

					<div id="3dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Broca's aphasia is a type of speech impairment located in the left frontal lobe. It sounds like broken speech. People with Broca's aphasia have difficulty with syntax. They speak slowly and have lots of pauses.

						<div class="panel-body">Wernicke's aphasia is a type of speech impairment located in the posterior temporal gyrus. The speech of a Wernicke's aphasic does not make semantic sense but the syntax is OK. There is some phonological impairment.

					</div>
					<div id="3dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A split brain patient has their corpus callosum severed so their right hemisphere cannot communicate with their left hemisphere. It tells us that the left side of the brain is responsive for speech. The right side may not be able to speak but it can still draw shapes. It tells us that the brain has independent functions.

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq1');">1. What is fast mapping? How do we know whether it is unique to human language? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>

					<div id="2dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Fast mapping is associating the meaning of a word with its referent in a single exposure. It is single trial learning. It is not unique to human language. Animals like dogs have mechanism for intelligence that we also share. A border collie can recognize new stuffed animals by name through the process of elimination.
							<br>

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq2');"> 2. What are some of the limitations on complex language ability observed from nonhuman primate studies? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="2dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Children learn without explicit instruction while dogs require extensive training. Dogs also don't have vocal chords. For chimps, they created few spontaneous signs. The word order was idosyncratic.
							<br>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq3');"> 3. What is the critical period? What evidence do we have for it? How does it support the idea that language is a biological system? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="2dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A critical period is the developmental time period in which language is learned. It is also a period of neural plasticity. The evidence for it is that babies who speak another language before puberty can become bilingual. A girl named Genie was abused and didn't learn language during the critical period. As a result, she never was able to speak properly. She couldn't use auxiliaries for example. This supports the idea that language is a biological system because Genie could not be trained to speak English properly. It shows that language must be learned during the critical period or else it is lost forever.

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq4');">4. What is a homesign system? Explain how Nicaraguan Sign Language is different. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="2dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A homesign system is a set of gestural signs spontaneously developed by deaf individuals to communicate when sign language is unknown. Nicaraguan Sign Language was developed by deaf children with considerable complexity. Younger students were able to adopt and learn twice as fast.

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('2dq5');">5. Explain the concept of double dissociation. How is it used in language research to support the idea that language is domain specific? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="2dq5" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Double association is the showing independence by finding distinct situations in which there's cognitive but not language impairment and language but not cognitive impairment. It supports the idea that language is domain specific, meaning some linguistic functions develop as modules.

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('1dq1');"> 1. Describe in your own words, what a model is. Give an example. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>

					<div id="1dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A model is a representation of reality. It should be guided by a research question and explain a desired phenomena. For example, given an image of a cat, a model can be a perfect fit, a good fit, or a poor fit. A perfect fit is an exact image of the cat. It is not simple nor generalizable. A good fit is a drawing of a cat. It is not the same as the image, but the drawing captures the qualities of the cat well. A poor fit is a cat stick figure. It is too simple and does not capture the likeless of the cat well.

					</div>
					<div id="1dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Model building should be predictive and falsifiable. It should also be simple but still capture the data accurately.

					</div>
					<div id="1dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A population is the group one's study is about. A sample is the group that one's study actually tested. We usually test a sample because a population is too large.

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('1dq4');"> 4. What is meant by a module? Give one property and explain its relation to illusions. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="1dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A module is a discrete processing unit that is organized by component parts. It is fast, automatic, mandatory, and isolated from other modules. The two pictures of Maragaret Thatcher is an optical illusion. We look for eyes and mouths to be oriented a certain way. When a face is upside but the eyes and mouths remain in their original positions, the image looks acceptable. But when we turn the image right-side up, the image looks completely distorted.
