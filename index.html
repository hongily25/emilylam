						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('12dq1');"> 1. Explain the phonological loop and how the word length effect indicates its limited capacity. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a>
			
			</h3>
					</div>

					<div id="12dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The phonological loop is when you store information in your phonology store and rehearse the information in working memory. The word length effect shows that we remember about 2 seconds worth of information in working memory. The word length effect is determined by how long it takes to say a word and not syllable. Longer words take more time to rehearse in working memory so it is harder to keep track of a list of longer words than shorter words.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('12dq2');">2. What is the articulatory suppression effect? Use the dual task logic to explain how the effect relates to the phonological loop. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="12dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The articulatory suppression effect is when a similar task interferes with the phonological loop. For example, saying "the" while you are trying to remember a list of words makes it harder to recall the list of words. The dual task logic says that you are better at doing two unrelated activities like chewing gum and walking vs. engaging the phonological loop with a related activity.

					</div>
					<div id="12dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">We measure reading span with reading tests and asking participants to remember the last word of a sentence. Reading span takes longer to process ORC than SRC.

			</h3>
					</div>

					<div id="11dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The active filler strategy wants to fill a gap triggered by a wh- word as soon as possible. I.e. Who did the boy see ___ ?

					</div>
					<div id="11dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">The filled gap effect is a penalty when the active filler strategy wants to fill a gap as soon as possible but it is already filled. I.e. Who did Bill say the president liked?

					</div>

						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('11dq3');">3. What is a saccade?  What is the perceptual span and how many characters are in it? What evidence do we have for it? <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="11dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A saccade is ballistic eye movement. It is moving from fixation point to the next fixation point. There are about 3-4 characters on the left and 7-8 characters on the right. We used an eye tracker and X'd out characters beyond 3-4 characters on the left and 7-8 characters on the right as people read. They didn't notice the Xs and were able to read without a problem.

					</div>
					<div id="11dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">It takes about the same amount of time to recognize a D if presented individually than if presented in a word like READ. It shows that we read words rather than individual letters at a time. It supports parallel and top-down processing since we don't read letters one at a time at a time but rather as whole words.

									<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('11dq5');">5. What is the dual route model of reading? Define each route and explain what evidence supports the independence of the two routes. <div class="pull-right"><span class=""></span></div></a></h3>
					</div>
					<div id="11dq5" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Phonological - turn letters into phonetic sound and then access the meaning. It happens as a fall back option for unusual words. The lexical route is more direct. You go from the word straight to the meaning. Pure alexia supports the independence of the two routes. People can recognize that letters are letters but they can't tell name them or recognize words. So they can read but not write.

							Whole object assumption - word labels refer to whole object. Ex. You hear gavagai and see a rabbit. What does gavagai mean?
							<br>
							<br> Taxonomic assumption - children choose taxonomic association over thematic association. Ex. If you have an image of a dog. "Find another fep". Children will choose the taxonomic associate.
							<br>
							<br> Mutual exclusivity - children assume that one word cannot refer to two different kinds of things. "Where is the dax"? Children will pick one. One association with one label.

					</div>

					<div id="2dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Fast mapping is associating the meaning of a word with its referent in a single exposure. It is single trial learning. It is not unique to human language. Animals like dogs have mechanism for intelligence that we also share. A border collie can recognize new stuffed animals by name through the process of elimination.

					</div>
					<div id="2dq2" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Children learn without explicit instruction while dogs require extensive training. Dogs also don't have vocal chords. For chimps, they created few spontaneous signs. The word order was idosyncratic.

					</div>
					<div id="2dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A critical period is the developmental time period in which language is learned. It is also a period of neural plasticity. The evidence for it is that babies who speak another language before puberty can become bilingual. A girl named Genie was abused and didn't learn language during the critical period. As a result, she never was able to speak properly. She couldn't use auxiliaries for example. This supports the idea that language is a biological system because Genie could not be trained to speak English properly. It shows that language must be learned during the critical period or else it is lost forever.

					</div>
					<div id="2dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A homesign system is a set of gestural signs spontaneously developed by deaf individuals to communicate when sign language is unknown. Nicaraguan Sign Language was developed by deaf children with considerable complexity. Younger students were able to adopt and learn twice as fast.

					</div>
					<div id="2dq5" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">Double association is the showing independence by finding distinct situations in which there's cognitive but not language impairment and language but not cognitive impairment. It supports the idea that language is domain specific, meaning some linguistic functions develop as modules.

					</div>

					<div id="1dq1" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A model is a representation of reality. It should be guided by a research question and explain a desired phenomena. For example, given an image of a cat, a model can be a perfect fit, a good fit, or a poor fit. A perfect fit is an exact image of the cat. It is not simple nor generalizable. A good fit is a drawing of a cat. It is not the same as the image, but the drawing captures the qualities of the cat well. A poor fit is a cat stick figure. It is too simple and does not capture the likeless of the cat well.

					</div>
					<div id="1dq3" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A population is the group one's study is about. A sample is the group that one's study actually tested. We usually test a sample because a population is too large.

					</div>
					<div id="1dq4" style="display:none;">
						<div class="panel-body">A module is a discrete processing unit that is organized by component parts. It is fast, automatic, mandatory, and isolated from other modules. The two pictures of Maragaret Thatcher is an optical illusion. We look for eyes and mouths to be oriented a certain way. When a face is upside but the eyes and mouths remain in their original positions, the image looks acceptable. But when we turn the image right-side up, the image looks completely distorted.
